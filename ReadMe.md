**动态迷宫 dynamic maze**

自动生成任意维度的迷宫，体验高纬度迷宫。
注意，因为没有很好利用高维运动特性，本质上还是二维迷宫。

本项目主要是提供一个游戏思路。


Automatically generate a maze of any dimension and experience a high-latitude maze.

Note that because the high-dimensional motion characteristics are not well utilized, it is still essentially a two-dimensional maze.

This project mainly provides a game idea.
